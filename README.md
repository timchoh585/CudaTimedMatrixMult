# CudaTimedMatrixMult

Both CUDA and C# code were from tutorials that we, Timothy Choh and Edmond Zalenski followed, respectively.

We do not take credit for the code.

CUDA code was from a Udacity class that was about Parallel Programming
C# code was from an website that teaches about parallelism in C#
