# CudaTimedMatrixMult

Both CUDA and C# code were from tutorials that we, Timothy Choh and Edmond Zalenski followed, respectively.

We do not take credit for the code.

CUDA code was from a Udacity class that was about Parallel Programming
C# code was from an website that teaches about parallelism in C#

#To Run
Open up the solution in Visual Studio.
Both codes are in the same sln project.

You will need Nvidia's CUDA ready card in order to run as well as the drivers.
